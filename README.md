# Sentiment Analysis of Customer Feedback

## 📌 Overview
This is a small exploratory project I created to learn and experiment with sentiment analysis libraries in Python. It uses **VADER** and **TextBlob** to classify sentiments (Positive, Neutral, Negative) and measure polarity and subjectivity. Visualizations such as bar charts, scatter plots, and word clouds provide insights into overall sentiment trends and common keywords.

⚠ **Note:** VADER sentiment scores are not always accurate. Please confirm findings manually before making any decisions.

## 🔍 Key Features
- **Sentiment Scoring**: Using VADER for compound scores and TextBlob for polarity/subjectivity.
- **Classification**: Categorizing feedback into Positive, Neutral, or Negative.
- **Visualizations**:
  - Sentiment distribution bar chart
  - Word cloud of frequent terms
  - Scatter plot of polarity vs. subjectivity
